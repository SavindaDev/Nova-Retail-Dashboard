# Nova-Retail-Dashboard

🛍️ Nova Retail Analytics Dashboard
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for Nova Retail, designed to transform raw sales and promotion data into actionable business insights. The dashboard not only visualizes performance but also uncovers hidden patterns that guide data-driven decision-making.

🚀 Project Goals

- Track sales performance: Identify top products, categories, and time periods driving revenue.
- Evaluate promotion & discount effectiveness: Understand whether campaigns actually increased sales or wasted resources.
- Provide a 360° business view for leadership to optimize strategy and spending.

🔧 What We Did

- Cleaned and transformed raw retail data.
- Built custom time and day-type tables for trend analysis (holidays, salary days, weekdays).
- Developed measures for multiple promotion types (multibuy, basket, unit, brand).
- Designed three interactive report pages:
  - Sales Overview → Weekly sales, top items, day-type comparison.
  - Promotion Analysis → Effectiveness by promotion type, item-level uplift.
  - Discount Analysis → Correlation between discounts and sales performance.
  
📈 Key Findings

- Promotions drive nearly half of total sales, but vendor & multibuy promotions are most impactful.
- Holiday sales underperform — a missed opportunity for targeted campaigns.
- Discounts alone don’t guarantee success; certain products remain low-selling despite price cuts.

✅ Recommendations

- Double down on high-ROI promotions (vendor & multibuy).
- Create strategic holiday campaigns to capture untapped demand.
- Use smart discounting — focus on items proven to respond positively.
