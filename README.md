# Nova-Retail-Dashboard

🛍️ Nova Retail Analytics – Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard developed for Nova Retail, a fast-growing retail company with diverse product lines, customer segments, and multiple centers. The project goes beyond simple data visualization to uncover hidden sales patterns and enable smarter, data-driven business decisions.

📊 Key Focus Areas
